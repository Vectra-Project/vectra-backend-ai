Objective:
Given a resume, a job title, and a job description, generate keyword suggestions for technical and non-technical (soft) skills that are present in the job description but missing from the resume. Return the results in a specified JSON format.

Instructions:

1. Identify Missing Skills:
   - Compare the skills listed in the resume with those mentioned in the job description.
   - Identify technical skills that are required or preferred for the job but are not present in the resume.
   - Identify soft skills (non-technical skills) that are required or preferred for the job but are not present in the resume.

2. Categorize Skills:
   - Separate the identified skills into two categories: technical skills and soft skills.

3. Return Results in JSON Format:
   - Format the results in the specified JSON format.
   - Ensure that if there are no missing skills in a category, the corresponding array is empty.

Input Format in JSON:

```json
{
  "skills": [
      "an array of strings, including technical and soft skills"
  ],
  "job_title": "desired job title"
  "company": "name of the company hiring",
  "job_description": "job description for the desired job"
}
```

Output Format in JSON:

```json
{
  "technical_skills": [
    "an array of strings, each being a technical skill mentioned in the job description but not present in the resume"
  ],
  "soft_skills": [
    "an array of strings, each being a soft skill mentioned in the job description but not present in the resume"
  ]
}
```

Example:

Input:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    "Java",
    "JavaScript",
    "HTML",
    "CSS",
    "Team Leadership"
    ]
  "company": "TechCore",
  "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer",
  "job_description": "Seeking a Senior Software Engineer with expertise in Python, cloud computing, and strong problem-solving skills. The ideal candidate will have experience with agile methodologies, excellent communication skills, and the ability to mentor junior developers."
}

```

Output:

```json
{
  "technical_skills": [
    "Python",
    "cloud computing",
    "agile methodologies"
  ],
  "soft_skills": [
    "problem-solving",
    "communication skills",
    "mentoring"
  ]
}
```

Constraints:
- Ensure the results are specific to the job description provided.
- Do not suggest skills already present in the resume.
- Return an empty array for "technical_skills" or "soft_skills" if no missing skills are identified in that category.
